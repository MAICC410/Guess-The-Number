# Python Guessing Game

Welcome to the Python Guessing Game! This simple command-line game challenges players to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100, with a choice of difficulty levels affecting the number of guesses allowed.


## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players interact directly with the game through the command line.
- **Variable Difficulty**: Players can choose between 'easy' and 'hard' difficulty settings, influencing the number of lives (guesses) they have.
- **ASCII Art Logo**: A fun ASCII art logo is displayed at the start of the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
2. **Choose Your Difficulty**: Type 'easy' for 10 lives or 'hard' for 5 lives.
3. **Make Your Guesses**: Enter your guesses based on whether you think the actual number is higher or lower than your guess.
4. **Win or Lose**: The game ends when you either guess the number correctly or run out of lives.
